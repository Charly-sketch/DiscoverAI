## Introduction

This project is a mini-game suite designed to introduce users to reinforcement learning (RL). It is built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing it to run easily in any web browser.

## Features

- **Simple User Interface**: Designed to be accessible for beginners.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: A basic Q-Learning network is used to make decisions based on the current game state.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd project-name
    ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in a browser**:
    - Simply double-click the `index.html` file or open it with your preferred web browser.

## User Guide

1. **Start the Game**:
    - Open `index.html` in your browser.
    - Click the "Start" button to begin the game.

2. **Game Controls**:
    - The game starts in pause mode. Click "Resume" to start.
    - The hero (ambulance) moves automatically using a reinforcement learning algorithm.

3. **Game Objectives**:
    - **Win**: Guide the ambulance to the hospital to score points.
    - **Lose**: Avoid buildings (villains) and stay within the map boundaries.

4. **Learning Visualization**:
    - The hero's movements and decisions are guided by the Q-Learning network. The Q values and epsilon are displayed to track the learning process.
